The pre- and post-interaction phases of the experiment consist of a Qualtrics survey in which participants first read about the Fukushima nuclear disaster (pre-interaction phase), then write personal narratives and generate hashtags related to the narrative (pre- and post-interaction phases). We applied a causal language analysis pipeline based on a RoBERTa-XL model to measure narrative shifts in participants' language data resulting from networked interaction.
