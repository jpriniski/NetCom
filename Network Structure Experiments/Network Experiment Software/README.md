The directories face_experiment and hashtag_experiment contain software for networked group interaction experiments. Both experiments allow for different network structures: homogeneously mixed groups (fully connected) and spatially embedded groups (ring-like). As shown below, a yellow node represents the potential interaction partners for a given participant. In the face_experiment, participants coordinate on the name of an image of a womanâ€™s face, while in the hashtag_experiment, participants coordinate on hashtag responses to an event narrative (see Priniski et al., 2024). Each experiment is preset to last for fourty interaction trials, but a user can update this paramter (see below). 

### Network structure conditions

The trial-level participant pairings for each network structure is in the custom_networks file.
