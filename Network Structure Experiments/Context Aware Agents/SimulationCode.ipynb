    "Arguments to run simulation:\n",
    "* **G, pairs:** Graph and a list of pairings. These are both output by calling gen_network. \n",
    "* **network_type:** either `'S'` (spatially embedded) or `'H'` (homogeneously mixing) depending on what the network type is. \n",
    "* **possible_choices:** refers to which prior is being used. Either `htprior` or `faceprior` depending on which experimental prior desired\n",
    "* **num_rounds:** number of rounds we want to run. Usually 40 for comparison to the experimental runs.\n",
    "* **alpha***: network-level learning parameter; numerical parameter for the background probability calculation can be any number â‰¥ 0.\n",
    "* **gamma***: network-level self-valuation parameter; value in [0, 1] that indicates preference for repeating self over repeating partner.\n",
    "* **response_type:** either `'Hashtag'` or `'Face'` depending on which prior is being used. This is only included so the output dataframes match the experimentally outputted dataframes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\* CAA simulation only\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Call **`gen_network(n, network_type, num_rounds)`** where `n` is the number of nodes, `network_type` is a string indicating either `'spatially_embedded'` or `'homogeneously_mixing'` and `num_rounds` is the number of desired simulation rounds (usually 40). \n",
    "2. Depending on which simulation you want to run, call either\\\n",
    "    a. **`centola_simulation(G, pairs, network_type, possible_choices, num_rounds, response_type)`** or\\\n",
    "    b. **`caa_simulation(G, pairs, network_type, possible_choices, num_rounds, alpha, gamma, response_type)`** \\\n",
    "    where each of the parameters are as defined above and the value for `num_rounds` is the same as the ones passed in to **`gen_network`**."
